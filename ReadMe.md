This project implement a full-cycle Data Science Research on 10k+ historical application records, including statistical analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modelling, and user interface design.

Deliverables:
1. Find out the important decision-making factors in the admission process
2. Predict whether the applicant would be offered a position(School’s Decision)
3. Predict whether the offer holders decide to accept the offer(Student’s Decision)

The notebooks following the order as:
*datacleansing.ipynb*: Implement Data Cleansing and Transformation.
*exploration-accept.ipynb*: The statistical analysis on the Factors of the Student’s Decision.
*exploration-offer.ipynb*: The statistical analysis on the Factors of the School’s Decision.
*modelling-accept.ipynb*: The machine learning modelling to predict whether the offer holders decide to accept the offer.
*modelling-offer.ipynb*: The machine learning modelling to predict whether the applicant would be offered a position.
*interface.ipynb*: The GUI for non-technical stakeholders to input the relevant admission data and obtain a prediction of whether the applicant would accept the offer.
